# UFOs
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The webpage filters according to given date. As to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time such as adding table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
1)People can filter using search filters such as city, state, country, and shape.
As shown in figure, we can search for particular date and city name.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
### Drawback: This process will not work when we have huge amount of data since it processes the table as soon as we try to enter in filter field. Once we are done with adding as many filter fields as we want, it should show the updated table data.  

### Recommendations: 
1) button called "Show Results" needs to be on the webpage so that we can fill as many filter filled as we want and then webpage will show results.

2) We can add more filters such as duration and comments included.
